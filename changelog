3.4.0b12
* NWS foid: BOX, lid: MAZ005 has multiple entries (actually, this is common)
  the forecast plugin picks the first one found.  To pick a different one,
  specify the location text as the lid_desc parameter.
  [Forecast]
      [[NWS]]
          lid = MAZ005
          lid_desc = Lowell-Middlesex MA
          foid = BOX
  Note: This is not required and, to speicify it, you need to examine
        the report returened from NWS.  Most users should ignore this
        change.
